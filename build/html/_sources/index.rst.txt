This user's guide documents the BREXX standard functions from 
https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/languages/rexx/brexx/html/rx.html as well as the
changes and amendments to BREXX to be used on MVS 3.8j.

- BREXX has been developed by Vasilis Vlachoudis, who made it publicly 
  available as freeware for non-commercial purposes.
- Jason Winter's JCC Compiler for compiled BREXX
- JCC and the JCC-Library are owned and maintained by him. While not
  being freeware, Jason allows non-commercial usage and distribution 
  of Software created using JCC through a relaxed license, as long as
  the complete source code always accompanies those distributions.
- Vasilis and Jason explicitly consented to make the JCC based version
  of BREXX available on TK4-. Thanks to both for their significant 
  valuable contribution to the TK4- MVS 3.8j Tur(n)key system.
- The VSAM Interface is based on Steve Scott's VSAM API.
- The FSS Part is based on Tommy sprinkle's FSS - TSO Full-Screen 
  Services
- Daniel Gaeta contributed his EXECIO implementation.
- The NJE38DIR load module was extracted out of Bob Polmanter's NJE38 
  V2 modules

Some Notes on BREXX Arithmetic Operations
-----------------------------------------

BREXX stores numeric values in the appropriate type format. The benefit 
compared to save it as strings is a significant performance improvement
during calculations. As the expensive string to numeric conversion
before and vice versa after arithmetic operations is omitted; this
allows speedy calculations without the required conversion overhead.

BREXX supports two numeric types:

- **Integer** Integers are stored in 4-bytes a full word (LONG), this 
  means their range is from -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647

- **Decimal Numbers** Decimal Numbers (decimal numbers with a fractional
  part) are represented in the double-precision floating-point format
  (doubleword), the length is 8-bytes consisting of an exponent and the 
  significand (fraction). It consists of 56 bits for the fraction part, 
  7-bit exponent and one-bit for the sign. This representation is IBM 
  specific and differs slightly from the IIEE 754 floating-point
  standard. 
  
  The precision of floating-point numbers is not as good as 
  decimal packed numbers which are not supported in BREXX (nor in REXX).
  This means, for example, 2.0 might be stored as 19999999999999999e-17,
  or for 5.0 you will is stored as 50000000000000003e-17; this is not an
  error, but the usual behaviour for floating-point numbers. It is
  caused by the conversion between the numbers of base 10 to base two a 
  bit-exact reversibility is not always given. This effect may build up 
  during arithmetic calculations.
